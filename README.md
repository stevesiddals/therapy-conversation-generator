Use the AI therapy conversation generator here: https://ai-therapy.streamlit.app/

 ## Purpose
* **Explore how AI therapy works** by generating conversations with a variety of clients situations and therapeutic approaches
* **Review conversations** others have generated to get ideas and inspiration for how AI works in this context
* **Compare different therapeutic approaches** for different client contexts
* **Contribute your ideas** to further research

## Background
Generative AI may have potential to provide meaningful emotional support. A recently published study interviewed
19 individuals about their experiences of using AI for mental health, finding that:
* Users experienced meaningful emotional support and guidance
* AI interactions helped improve real-world relationships
* Participants reported healing from trauma and loss
* Users emphasised the need for more sophisticated safety measures
